# Assembler School: Code Review and Evaluation Guide

In this guide we will learn several best practices on doing code reviews and evaluating projects as an Assembler School Student. Bellow you can find several articles written by the Assembler School team and at the end of this `README` you can also find resources if you'd like to learn more about code reviews.

### Learn more üìñ

If you'd like to learn more about code reviews, in the [Resources](#resources) section you will find several videos and articles. The ones labelled as **_Highly Recommended_** are the ones you should see first and the ones labeled as **_Optional_** are there if you want to get a deep dive into the topic.

## Code Review Best Practices üßê

Before you start evaluating pills & projects you **must** read these best practices first so that you know how to give feedback in the most constructive and professional manner.

In this page you will see several best practices and tips & tricks of doing code reviews in way that is professional, mindful of your colleagues feelings and that it ensures that the code base of your team doesn't deteriorate over time.

## Pill & Projects Evaluation Guidelines ‚úÖ

In this page you will see a step-by-step guide of how to use Github to create a pull request and review the code with your team.

## What is a code review? üë©‚Äçüíª

A `code review` is an activity that usually involves an **author** of the code and a **reviewer** in charge of reading the author's code and deciding when the changes are ready to be merged in the projects code base.

Before the author submits a code review, the author must create a **changelist** that includes a set of changes to source code that the author wants to merge in to the team's codebase.

### Example of a changelist (pull request description and title):

**PR Title** [Solution: + Your Full Name]

```
Solution: Ana Marks
```

**PR Description**

```txt
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789
```

A review begins when the author sends their changelist to the reviewer. Code reviews happen in **rounds**.

Each round is one complete round-trip between the author and reviewer: the author sends changes, and the reviewer responds with written feedback on those changes. Every code review has one or more rounds.

The review ends when the reviewer **approves** the changes. This is commonly referred to as giving LGTM, shorthand for "**Looks Good to Me.**"

## Key points to consider when doing code reviews üëÄ

The main objective of doing code reviews is to make sure that the overall code health of your team's code is improving over time. It's not about showing off the skills or knowledge of a reviewer or author, it's about learning together as a team and improving the overall skill level and code quality.

- [ ] Reviewers should not be a barrier for integrating code into the code base
- [ ] Developers should be able to make progress and add new features to the app
- [ ] The overall code health should not deteriorate with each change
- [ ] Reviewers should favor approving a changelist if it doesn't deteriorate the overall code health
- [ ] There is no such thing as perfect code
- [ ] Code should improve the readability, maintainability and understandability of the overall system
- [ ] Are the main software principles being respected?
- [ ] Is the code too complex and over-engineered? If the author adds features or logic that is not currently needed, the reviewers should be vigilant and encourage developers to solve the problem that needs to be solved now and not include any premature optimization.
- [ ] Is the code tested?
- [ ] Are tests testing the wright thing?
- [ ] Are tests too complex?

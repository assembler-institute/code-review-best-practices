## List of pull requests of previous solutions

In order to write the feedback on the solutions of your colleagues you will have to open the base repository in the Assembler School Github page of the pill/project.

The solutions of all the students are always provided as Pull Requests. Therefore, you should find the PR of the person you are responsible of reviewing their code and then adding your review there.

## Writing the feedback

In this example we will open the `Solution: Pau Garcia Pellicer` PR.

To open the form to write the comments, you will have to hover a single line of code in the file changed and click on the plus icon.

Then, you should write the comments and click on the `Start a review` button to add the comment.
